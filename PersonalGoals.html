  <h1>What is a 'Personal Goal'?</h1>
</div>

<hr style="position: relative; top:125px">

<div class="row personaltext">
  <div class="col-md-5 ml-auto mr-auto text-left"> A personal goal has no set definition as it can mean a number of things. To us, a personal goal is a goal that is tailored to you and works around your needs as a human. For this sub-topic, we will be straying away slightly from the fitness and mental health side of things and will be edging closer to personal development. This does not mean that mental health and fitness cannot be incorporated here, it just means that discussion about other goals in your life are more than welcome. If you need advice on planning, organisation or general personal development tips then this sub-topic will be perfect for you!
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-5 ml-auto mr-auto text-left">We are aware that personal goals can indeed be very personal and not something that you would want to share with the world. We encourage you if you are struggling to meet this personal goal, to share it in an ambiguous or metaphoric way. This could help lift some weight off your chest and get some well-needed advice in the meantime. We are hoping that the ActiveGoals salon will be a non-judgemental zone and therefore we encourage everyone to be as open as they can! This sub-topic may seem unconnected to the other sub-topics, but we see it was a general overview and summary of all the sub-topics!

  This kind of goal can make you live your life to the fullest! We all live busy lives with countless distractions, being mindful of this and what is going on around you can be an invaluable skill to have. Take short breaks throughout your day and just observe what is happening around you. This can lead to a more fulfilled and happy life, meditation is a great way to practice mindfulness.

  Productivity is an incredibly important skill for anyone to learn. If you struggle with procrastination, then here are some tips to help you become more productive. The first tip is to break everything down into smaller steps. For example, if you have a 2,000-word essay to do, break it down into 4 segments and write 500 words at a time. This will help you concentrate while also leaving time for breaks!

  As mentioned throughout our website, exercise is the ultimate medication for mental health! Even if you do not suffer from any mental health problems, exercise will definitely make you feel better about yourself and has numerous benefits. One of these benefits is increased confidence which will benefit you in all aspects of your life! Everyone has time for exercise no matter how busy you think you are, so there's no reason not to start!

  The people you surround yourself with, make you the person you are. This is why it is important to surround yourself with good people! Having toxic people who constantly beat you down will have a negative impact on your life. Take a minute and reflect on the people you spend the most time with and think: are they having a negative or a positive impact on me? Identify the negative people and get them out of your life.
