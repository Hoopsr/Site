  <h1>What do we mean by 'Cardio Goals'?</h1>

  <div class="col-md-5 ml-auto mr-auto text-left"> Cardio Goals is another one of our topics we will be exploring in the salon. Cardio is the most popular form of exercise so we expect this topic to be full of conversation and life! Much like strength training, cardio is a great way to forget about all of your responsibilities for a short period of time and home in all of your focus and attention to one specific thing. Cardio comes with many great benefits for the mind and body, so many infact there's no way we could list them all! We will, however, do our best to list as many positive benefits as we can in the space below!
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-5 ml-auto mr-auto text-left"> The biggest misconception about cardio is that it is only good for weight loss and improving overall health. While it does induce weight loss and improve overall health, cardio can be an incredibly powerful medication for treating mental health conditions. As mentioned in the Strength Goals section, exercise produces endorphins that increase your happiness! Some studies have shown that cardio beats every other form of exercise at this and therefore is the best form of exercise for releasing endorphins!

	Time-based goals are the most popular way of tracking your cardio progress. An example of this kind of goal is to run a mile in 6 minutes or less. The best way to reach your time-based goal is to work your way up to your final goal. This is done by establishing smaller goals, working your way through them and each workout gradually lowering this time until you reach your final goal.

	<div class="col-sm-4 text-center ml-auto mr-auto">
	 Measuring your resting heart rate is the most scientifically accurate way of measuring your cardiovascular health. The lower your resting heart rate, the healthier your cardiovascular system is. This form of goal setting is most commonly used by people with the main aim of improving their own health as your cardiovascular system is a good reflection of your overall health.

		   Establishing a set distance to achieve is another form of cardio goal setting. An example of this would be to do a 5k run or to run 10 miles around a park. This kind of goal helps them push the pain barrier as they know they have to keep running until they've reached their goal and cannot stop before then.
